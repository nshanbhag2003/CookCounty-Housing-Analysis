We seek the analyze the history of racial discrimination in housing properties and taxation in Cook County, IL and present an optimal solution that reflects fairness and equity in modeling outcomes for property owners. We achieve this by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to develop a linear (OLS) model for predicting housing prices. This includes specifying and fitting the model with selected features, analyzing model errors, and proposing improvements to enhance model performance.
